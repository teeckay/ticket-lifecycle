<p>

I start by accessing the ticketing system as an end user to create new tickets and submit them to the system.

</p>

</p>
<br />
<p>

I then create a new ticket as Karen Karen, using a previously entered help topic stating a Business Critical Outage. I then submit the ticket. 

</p>

</p>
<br />
<p>

Next I log in as an agent, Jane Doe, to see what tickets I have.

</p>

<br />
<p>

Next I assign the ticket to Jane Doe, update the ticket priority to emergency, update the SLA plan to Sev-A, and transfer the ticket from the Support Department to the System Administrators Department for better handling as they are responsible and better equipped for this type of ticket.

</p>

<p>

</p>
<br />
<p>

Now the ticket is assigned with a set priority from Normal to Emergency and is ready to be worked on by the System Administrators.

</p>

</p>
<br /><p>

Now, the Issue is addressed and fixed by the System Administrators to get the mobile banking website back and running and I set the ticket to “resolved”. It turns out there was a load balancer issue that was fixed by Jerry. 

</p>

</p>
<br /><p>

The Mobile banking issue ticket #781043 assigned to the System Administrators is now closed.

</p>

</p>
<br /><p>

Next, I log in as a different agent: John Doe, who has a ticket assigned to him by Jane Doe to then resolve and close the ticket.

</p>

<p>

</p>
<br />

<p>

John Doe, resolves and closes his assigned ticket.

<p>
This is just a few examples on the day to day activites on Ticketing Systems. It however plays a vital role in IT service management.
